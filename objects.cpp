/* Welcome to the notes for cpp objects. Within this code we annotate the definitive caveats with wich we utilize wach of the many pieces of C++ objects, in particular, with relevancy to the C++ STL 11 ISO Standard. Here, I will also provide the correct and typical use of certian C++ methods. */

 Import Statements enumerate the specified libraries which will be inherited into our program. In this case, we are importing the library "iostream" and the "String" library. The "iostream" library is included with the ___ and it will be either called directly by oir program or compiled as runtime or when the program is initialized. I have to see how it is particularly initialized and also in the amount of data bytes each of these libraries utlizes. I want to do this to get an exact estimate of the importes libraries amd if the enitre library is imported into our program or if we only utilize its components as runtime.
